The image is very nice. I think this is street photography. Playing string instruments is fun. I wonder where this photo was taken. I also think black and white photography is useful for showing form.
Something interesting is that this street is mostly people walking. There are no cars except the parked car, I think.

Good point. We should refrain from judgement.
We should take the time to learn more about the place.
Learning takes time.

The image was a metaphor for learning about communities.
It takes time to find the details in a community.

"Yeah I think that metaphor makes sense. It takes time to learn about things such as the community. Kinshasa is a very large city."

I was at the CELF session today.

This session was called the reflection session. Angel spoke about the values again:

Confidentiality
Honesty
Respect others and yourself
Share whatever you feel comfortable with
There was then a photograph which Angel used as a metaphor for the work people need to do to learn about a community. It takes time to learn about a community.

I plan to help out an event which will benefit the North Illinois Food Bank: https://runsignup.com/Race/IL/OakBrook/FightHunger
